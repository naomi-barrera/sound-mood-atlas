# Sound Mood Atlas

*A digital experiment in mapping music to emotion through expressive, interactive design.*

Sound Mood Atlas explores how would, color, and emotion intersect.
Users can upload or enter songs, and the system visualizes their emotional characteristics through interactive UI, motion, and gradients.

This project blends front-end engineering, design sensibility, and creative tech ~ a playground for experimenting with music, mood, and visual storytelling.

# Concept
Music carries emotional metadata ~ energy, mood, tone, intensity ~ and those qualities shift depending on our inner world.

The goal of this project is to:
* translate those emotional qualities into visual form
* explore expressive UI patterns
* prototype emotional interactions (color, motion, shape)
* create a "map" or "atlas" of song moods
* reflect how our listening habits reveal emotional patterns over time (e.g., 'what was my mood of all the songs I downloaded in May?')

This is both a technical and artistic project.

# Tech Stack
* React + Typescript
